# Person-Re-identification-using-Siamese-networks

## About 
This is project about person re-identification. For Person re-identification most importantant things is feature extraction. According to microsoft research "deeper the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) better the result." So for feature extraction i have used this concept. For image comparision siamese network is best and well known apporach in person re-identification.
